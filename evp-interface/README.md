OpenSSL EVP - high-level cryptographic functions, The EVP functions or EVP library provide a high level interface to OpenSSL cryptographic functions.

In order to use EVP to perform encryption/decryption you are able to select different algorithm, mode, key and IV.

It is very flexible to use and make your data process more secure, especially for cloud storage project, it is safer to encrypt your data file and then store on to cloud storage.

IV - stands for Initialization Vector

This repo demonstrate how to use OpenSSL EVP functions to encrypt and decrypt data or data files.
